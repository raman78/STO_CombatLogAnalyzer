# Healing model

How the analyzer decides which of the three healing pools a record belongs to,
and why each pool is stored in two grouping orders.

Damage is unaffected by everything in this document.

## Purpose

The STO combat log has no notion of "healing done" versus "healing received" —
it emits one record per heal tick, carrying a source, an optional indirect
source (a console or a pet), and a target. Any of the three may be the player.
The analyzer has to derive the direction, and until it did so explicitly, a
player healing themselves was recorded **twice**: once because they were the
source, once because they were the target.

The scale of that double count on a real 212 MB log, for one player:

| pool                 | ticks | total      | hull  | shield   |
|----------------------|-------|------------|-------|----------|
| received from others | 859   | 778 635    | 478 k | 300 k    |
| done to others       | 2 076 | 353 042    | 90 k  | 260 k    |
| self                 | 5 528 | 54 553 454 | 300 k | 54 253 k |

54.55 M of 55.68 M was self healing, dominated by a single gear proc
(`Shield Absorptive Frequency Generator Proc`, 53.5 M). Counting it in both
directional pools made both of them read as that one proc, burying the 0.78 M
that actually came from teammates.

## What counts as a heal at all

`RecordValue::new` (`src/analyzer/parser.rs:268`) classifies a record before any
of this applies:

| condition                                                               | result                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `value_type == "HitPoints"`, `value1 < 0`                               | hull heal                             |
| `value_type == "Shield"`, `value2 == 0`, no `ShieldBreak`, `value1 < 0` | shield heal **or** damage — see below |
| `value_type == "Shield"`, `value2 == 0`, no `ShieldBreak`, `value1 > 0` | **shield drain damage**, not a heal   |

The third row surprises: a positive shield value with a zero second value is a
drain, and lands in the damage trees.

The second row is the one no single line can settle. The shield half of an
attack sometimes records a zero base magnitude, which makes it byte-identical to
a shield restore:

```text
Reflexive Emitters,      Shield, , -2000,    0     <- a genuine shield heal
Chain Conduit Capacitor, Shield, , -856.734, 0     <- an attack on a Borg's shields
```

Only the rest of the shot separates them: an attack also writes a damage line at
the same instant, on the same target, for the same ability; a heal does not.
`Parser::resolve_ambiguous_shield_line` (`src/analyzer/parser.rs`) reads ahead
over the remainder of the timestamp to look for it, and passes the answer into
`RecordValue::new`. Details and the caveats in `docs/COMBATLOG_FORMAT.md`.

On the reference log this moves **2 348** records out of healing and into shield
damage — over half of one player's Healing Ally, which is why abilities like
`Chain Conduit Capacitor` used to show up as "healing" enemy drones.

The converse rule would be wrong and is not applied: a shield line with *no*
companion is not necessarily a heal. 9 364 lines in the reference log are
attacks whose shields absorbed the whole shot, so no hull line exists
(`Quad Disruptor Cannons`, `Disruptor Turret`, `Plasma Storm`). Only lines with
a zero base magnitude are ever in question.

## Invariants

- **H1 — disjoint.** Every heal tick lands in exactly one of `heal_ally`,
  `heal_received`, `heal_self`. Summing all three double counts nothing.
- **H2 — order-equivalent.** `HealPool::by_person` and `HealPool::by_ability`
  hold the same ticks. Any aggregate (total, tick count, HPS) is identical
  between them; only the nesting differs.
- **H3 — damage untouched.** The routing change applies to `RecordValue::Heal`
  only. Self-directed *damage* still counts as incoming damage, as before.

## Routing

`Analyzer::process_next_record` (`src/analyzer/mod.rs:180`) calls
`Player::add_out_value` for records the player sources, and
`Player::add_in_value` for records that target them. For heals the two are
gated:

```
                       heal record
                            │
              ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
      source is this player        target is this player
              │                            │
   heal_lands_on_self()?            source is this player?
        │           │                  │           │
       yes          no                yes          no
        │           │                  │           │
   heal_self    heal_ally          (dropped —    heal_received
                                 already counted
                                  by the source
                                     branch)
```

`Player::heal_lands_on_self` (`src/analyzer/mod.rs:585`) decides the left side;
`source_is_self` (`src/analyzer/mod.rs:667`) gates the right side so a self heal
is not counted a second time.

### Record shapes and where they go

Every shape below was observed in a real log. `me` is the player whose pools are
being filled.

| source       | indirect    | target       | example                                           | pool                             |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| me           | —           | —            | `Reflexive Emitters`, `Brace for Impact III`      | `heal_self`                      |
| me           | my console  | me           | `Bio-Molecular Shield Generator Fabrication`      | `heal_self`                      |
| me           | —           | me           | explicit self-target                              | `heal_self`                      |
| me           | — / console | other player | `Rally Cry V` → `Sirak`                           | `heal_ally`                      |
| me           | — / console | NPC          | → `U.S.S. Birmingham`, `Security Escort III`      | `heal_ally`                      |
| me           | my pet      | —            | `Motivated Strikes` through `Security Escort III` | `heal_ally`, credited to the pet |
| other player | — / console | me           | `Shield Generator Energy Matrix` from `Bor'ar`    | `heal_received`                  |
| NPC          | —           | me           | ally (or oddly-signed enemy) ability              | `heal_received`                  |

The pet row is deliberate: `src=me, ind=my pet, tgt=-` heals the *pet*, not the
player, so it is healing done with the pet as recipient — which is what
`add_out_value`'s existing recipient fallback (`target.name()` else
`indirect_source.name()`) already produced.

`src=NPC, ind=me` (an NPC healing while the player is the indirect source)
stays in `heal_received`, matching the pre-split behaviour. It occurred 8 times
in a 212 MB log; it was not worth a rule of its own.

## Grouping orders

`HealGroup::add_heal` (`src/analyzer/groups.rs:394`) reads a path **back to
front**: the last segment becomes the top level of the tree, `path[0]` becomes
the leaf. `Player::add_heal_to_pool` (`src/analyzer/mod.rs:716`) exploits that to
file each tick twice from one path:

```
build_grouping_path() ──► [ Value(ability), Group(indirect)?, Group(custom)? ]
                                        │
                            push(person), unless self
                                        │
                    ┌───────────────────┴───────────────────┐
              as built                                  reversed
                    │                                       │
      person → indirect → ability            ability → indirect → person
       (HealPool::by_person)                    (HealPool::by_ability)
```

The second order is the first one read backwards, which is what makes the
nesting an exact mirror. Moving the person to the front of the path instead
would leave whatever `build_grouping_path` put last on top — the pet or console
for a heal routed through one, not the ability the order is named after. That
was the original construction, and on a real log it showed
`KUZGUN ⏵ Jem'hadar Wingman ⏵ Engineering Team III` under the ability order.

**Self healing carries no person segment.** The other party is always the player
whose pool it is, so a level naming them again adds a click and no information.
The two orders there differ only by whether the ability or the console the heal
came from sits on top, which is why that tab labels the picker "Source" rather
than "Person".

Both orders are built during analysis rather than pivoted in the UI, because the
tree carries per-node metrics and percentages computed by
`HealPool::recalculate_metrics` and `HealPool::recalculate_percentages`
(`src/analyzer/heal.rs`). Re-nesting in the UI would mean recomputing those; the
alternative — re-parsing on every toggle — costs 3.3 s on a 212 MB log. The cost
paid instead is one duplicate copy of the heal ticks, roughly 9 MB for a
212 MB log. Heal ticks are a small fraction of the record volume, so this was
the cheaper trade.

`HealTab` (`src/app/main_tabs/heal_tab.rs`) builds a table for each order up
front and `show_grouping_picker` (`src/app/main_tabs/heal_tab.rs:78`) selects
which one is drawn. Switching drops `selection_diagrams`, because the two tables
track their own expansion and selection state and a chart built from one no
longer corresponds to what is on screen.

## Metric bases

| metric       | denominator                                             | source                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| DPS          | player `combat_time` (first to last damage dealt)       | `Player::recalculate_metrics` |
| HPS, ticks/s | player `active_time` (first to last action of any kind) | same                          |

The two healing rates therefore use a different time base than DPS in the
neighbouring tabs. This predates the split and was left alone; the column
tooltips in `src/app/main_tabs/tables/heal_table.rs` now state it.

`HealMetrics::critical_percentage` (`src/analyzer/heal.rs`) divides the crit
count by **hull** ticks while counting crits across all ticks. That is correct
in practice: a scan of a 212 MB log found 433 critical hull heals and **zero**
critical shield heals — STO does not crit shield healing. It is not enforced
structurally the way the damage side enforces it
(`src/analyzer/damage.rs:144`), so a future game change would surface as a
critical percentage above 100.

## Verification

Two independent implementations agree on the split. `dump_heal_pools`
(`src/analyzer/mod.rs`, `#[ignore]`) totals the pools straight from the
analyzer:

```
CLA_TEST_COMBATLOG=<path> cargo test dump_heal_pools -- --ignored --nocapture
```

On the 212 MB reference log it reports `received 778635 / done 353042 /
self 54553454`, matching a standalone count of the raw records to the unit.

Unit coverage, all in `src/analyzer/mod.rs`:

| test                                                 | asserts                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `healing_is_split_into_three_disjoint_pools`         | H1, plus the hull/shield split per pool                                            |
| `a_heal_between_two_players_lands_in_opposite_pools` | a cross-player heal is done for one side, received for the other, self for neither |
| `a_heal_pool_holds_both_grouping_orders`             | H2, and that each order nests the way it claims                                    |
